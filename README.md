SMS / Email Spam Detector
A Machine Learning–based Spam Detection Web App that classifies messages as Spam or Not Spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a trained ML model.
Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

Features
	•	Detects Spam vs Ham (Not Spam) messages
	•	Text preprocessing using NLP:
	  •	Lowercasing
	  •	Tokenization
	  •	Stopword removal
	  •	Stemming
	•	Uses TF-IDF Vectorization
	•	Machine Learning model trained on SMS dataset
	•	Simple and interactive Streamlit UI
	•	Fast and lightweight
